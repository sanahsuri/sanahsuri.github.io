*In my dissertation, advised by Dr. Ari Stern, and titled 'Functional Equivariance and Backward Error Analysis', I present the modified vector field perspective of functional equivariance, and formalize conjugate functional equivariance.  

* I worked with Dr. Donsub Rim to develop a novel low rank expansion of neural networks. We postulated that instabilities in neural networks, in the form of adversarial examples, can be generated and studied using this low rank expansion.

* I currently work with Dr. Maike Sonnewald at the Computational Climate and Ocean Lab at UC Davis. We are currently exploring the use of explainable artificial intelligence technqiues to gain insight into the physics learned by machine learning models in the context of ocean dynamics.
