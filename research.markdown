* In my dissertation, advised by [Dr. Ari Stern](https://www.math.wustl.edu/~astern/), and titled 'Functional Equivariance and Backward Error Analysis', I present the modified vector field perspective of functional equivariance, develop an algebraic characterization of functional equivariance and formalize conjugate functionally equivariant integrators.

* I worked with [Dr. Donsub Rim](https://dsrim.github.io) to develop a novel low rank expansion of neural networks. We postulate that instabilities in neural networks, in the form of adversarial examples, can be generated and studied using this mathematical expansion. We applied this expansion to a convolutional neural network (CNN) for tsunami early warning and found adversarial perturbations comparable to those obtained using projected gradient descent and developed filters for noisy input.

* I currently work with [Dr. Maike Sonnewald](https://msonnewald.com) at the [Computational Climate and Ocean Group](https://compclimate.github.io/ccog.github.io/) at UC Davis. We are currently exploring the use of explainable artificial intelligence technqiues to gain insight into the physics learned by machine learning models in the context of ocean dynamics, with specific applications to Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC).
