**About me**

I am a fifth-year PhD candidate in Mathematics at Washington University in St. Louis, advised by Dr. Ari Stern. My research focuses on structure-preserving numerical integration and machine learning, with applications to climate and ocean systems. Learn more about the applications and impact of my work in this article from the Arts & Sciences magazine: [Math for a Changing World](https://artsci.washu.edu/ampersand/math-changing-world).
